# U3229966 Tydah Ngep - Assignment 3 - One-Page Site

### Developer Notes

This was my first experience website building, so I found it quite difficult to begin and gain a stable footing with this assignment. I hadn't coded in HTML, CSS or JS prior to this, but did have experience in other languages such as Python and C#, which managed to carry me through a little.

I wanted to create a small, brief website that held information on the Australian Games Industry, such as the effects it had on people, how to start making games and also included links to well-known games that have been made in Australia. I made sure all the images had some element of interactivity, such as when clicked on lead to other websites and resources. I'm pretty proud of the image and embeds of the website and links, as they turned out the way I wanted them to. The slideshow took me a while to get working, but I still managed to make it look the way I wanted to.

W3Schools, along with my peers who had more experience in website development helped me in creating the website. I wanted to create something more interactive and engaging, but due to the time constraints of the due date and other pending assignments I couldn't make it to the extent I wanted to. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed learning these new programming languages and understanding how they worked. I might continue developing these skills in the future.
